realization: there is no minimum length to a blog post. Any microblog post was
just a short blog post. Perhaps the idea with it was to participate in the

<p>Perhaps this will affect my blogging frequency, perhaps not. One thing that will
be different is the blog will focus on informal writings, perhaps even to just
say <em>I ate a nice pizza today</em>, and I’ll start working on having a content
vs. journal style separation between the blog.</p>
