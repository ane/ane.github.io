    <p>Out of all Lisps the ones I’ve come to appreciate the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common
Lisp</a>. <!--break-->These two languages are fundamentally very different: Scheme
is a minimalist language built on the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>, while
Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm synthesis of many Lisps before it. Common Lisp
is a large standard with many implementations, Scheme is a collection of an
evolving but minimalistic standard with many implementations. The core of Scheme
is quite small compared to Common Lisp. The latest standard <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/final/r6rs-lib.pdf">R6RS</a> is about 65
pages, while the ANSI Common Lisp standard from 1994 is about 1100 pages. The
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/">Scheme Requests for Implementation</a> process aims to standardize additional
features (like <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html">test suites</a>) that implementations may implement.</p>

<p>Common Lisp has some wonderful features, <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/beyond-exception-handling-conditions-and-restarts.html">conditions and restarts</a>, the <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html">Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS)</a>, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">the macro system</a>, among many other things. The <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY
IDE for Emacs</a> is <em>amazing</em>, and the <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a> compiler is really
great. It has <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/index.html">Quicklisp</a> and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/">ASDF</a> for package and build management,
respectively. I find the developer experience of Common Lisp to be superior to
almost anything imaginable, and this is not an empty statement: having used all
sorts of IDEs and editors for over 25 years, I have seen <em>many</em>.</p>

<h3 id="tastes-differ">Tastes differ</h3>

<p>That said, Common Lisp is <em>weird</em>. What I find particularly jarring is that
functions and variables live in different namespaces: if you put a function into
a variable, you can’t just use it like a function, you have to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funcall</code> it.
Having programmed in lots of languages of the ML family this is just, well, odd;
but this is due to historical reasons and there are <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/Technical-Issues.html">sound technical reasons for
it</a>.  There are other
oddities, some strange things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(cdr '())</code> is not an error (in Scheme it
is), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code> are equal (in Scheme <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#f</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code> are separate things), and
so on.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a fault in Common Lisp: other languages have impacted my taste
and preferences to bias me in the direction of Scheme, but that is not to say I
cannot work with Common Lisp’s idiosyncracies. Actually, I don’t mind them, I
just <em>notice</em> them.</p>

<p>I like the naming styles of Scheme more, as well. It has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string?</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string-p</code>
for predicate functions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set!</code>  for state modifying functions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo-&gt;bar</code> for
conversions, these make code quite easier to read. Scheme has hygienic macros,
Guile has the traditional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defmacro</code> as well.</p>

<p>Many nice Scheme features are available in Common Lisp libraries. Pattern match
is available in the <a href="https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia">trivia</a> library. Named lets are easy to implement with a macro.</p>

<p>Common Lisp aficionados are quick to point out things Scheme <em>doesn’t</em> have:
keyword arguments, docstrings, rest arguments, but my Scheme implementation of
choice Guile has these built into the language.</p>

<h3 id="productivity-matters">Productivity matters</h3>

<p>Guile is in a strange niche is that its primary <em>raison d’être</em> is to be an
extension language for the GNU project. Like Emacs Lisp is for extending Emacs,
Guile is the <em>de facto</em> language for GNU programs for extension and scripting.</p>

<p>Guile doesn’t have Quicklisp and its package manager and build system is
basically nonexistent for the first and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf</a> for the second. There is
<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2017-03/msg00168.html">sentiment</a> in the Guile community to have <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> as the package manager for
Guile. This might sound a bit onerous, since Guix is also a complete package
management for many other things than Guile, but consider this: as Andy Wingo
points out in his message that Guile libraries often come with C extensions,
Guile packages need some sort of managed build system for building the C
extensions. Since it doesn’t have one, to solve the problem of building a
package manager you’d also have to build a build system that can manage C code
and packages needed by the C code bits. To do this elegantly is a gargantuan
task, for instance, <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions#installing-eggs-that-use-libraries">chicken-install just asks you to put compiler/linker flags
on the command line before calling it</a>, so it obviously is a hard problem.</p>

<p>Now, Guix solves all that, and more, in a manner that is quite elegant and
interesting. But it’s not as lightweight as something like Quicklisp or
<a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Extensions"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chicken-install</code></a> from <a href="http://call-cc.org/">CHICKEN Scheme</a>. What is more, Guix works only on GNU/Linux
systems really, so macOS and Windows users won’t be able to do use your library
if you plan on distributing it via Guix. Duh, it’s the GNU project, but
portability is always nice.</p>

<p>But in Common Lisp I can write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(ql:quickload :alexandria)</code> and voilà, it will
automatically install the <a href="http://quickdocs.org/alexandria/">Alexandria</a> library that I can use. Then again, in
Common Lisp it’s somewhat rarer to have C extensions, so I don’t know how ASDF
handles that.</p>

<p>It is unfair to compare <a href="http://joaotavora.github.io/sly/">SLY</a> to <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/geiser/">Geiser</a>, the best Emacs Scheme integration
package.  SLY is based on <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> which has <em>decades</em> of man-years of work behind
it. Geiser is able to support multiple Scheme implementations and it is quite
impressive in this regard. But SLY obviously has much more (e.g. an interactive
debugger). That said, Geiser has nice Guile support, and Guile is in general the
most Common Lisp-y of all Schemes, in fact, it has</p>

<ul>
  <li>an imitation of CLOS in the form of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/goops/">GOOPS</a></li>
  <li>docstrings and keyword, rest, and optional arguments for function
definitions</li>
  <li>an interactive REPL and a mutable top-level (unlike many Schemes)</li>
  <li>a nice module system</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Defmacros.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defmacro</code></a> and exceptions somewhat <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Raising-and-Handling-Exceptions.html">similar to Common Lisp restarts </a></li>
</ul>

<p>and some nice things Common Lisp doesn’t have like first-class
continuations. But then again I would use those rarely.</p>

<h3 id="when-would-i-pick-one-over-the-other">When would I pick one over the other?</h3>

<p>If I were to write an extensible C/C++/Rust program that I <em>know</em> will need to use
a low-level language, I might do the low level bits using a low level language
and then write the rest in Guile. Guile makes it very easy to spin up a REPL
socket to do something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myprogram --repl=12345</code> that you can connect to, and
the interop between C and Guile is fantastic, it has to be, as it’s primarily an
extension language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if were to build a wholly standalone application, the choice is
not as obvious. I could do the whole thing in either language. Common Lisp can
build native executables, although their size will be large (who cares?) since
the binary will include the whole Lisp implementation. Guile cannot compile to
native code so you’ll have to write a script executable, but that doesn’t really
matter.</p>

<p>Scenarios where I would pick Guile:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I’m making an extensible program that has to have some C/C++ bits but I
want to make it scriptable by users</li>
  <li>when I want to write a native binary but not write too much C/C++ code</li>
  <li>I just want to write Scheme, because Scheme is a bit more elegant</li>
  <li>the project has something to do with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU project</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, Common Lisp makes the most sense if I just want to enjoy a
seriously rapid development experience, a large standard library and language,
and I don’t mind having 50MB binaries (again, who cares?) if I were to write
standalone programs. Guile can’t do that, but it’s easy to either write Guile
scripts or a C program that essentially bootstraps a binary to load a Scheme
runtime. This is how <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is written, for example.</p>

<p>So the answer to which one is decidedly <strong>both</strong>! Both languages are really fun to
write. At the moment I don’t do Lisp at my day job so it’s all for fun
anyway. If this were for professional purposes, I don’t know. Very often a
strict requirement for professional work is to be able to be productive. In that
regard I think Common Lisp has a significant edge, not only due to its superior
development experience, but its history as a real production language. There are
actual companies doing stuff in Common Lisp. I have not heard of any
professional (in the industrial sense) uses of Guile, notwithstanding that many
projects powered by Guile (Guix, etc.)  are <em>extremely</em> professional in the way
they are written and maintained. But Common Lisp has <em>more</em> libraries and
companies behind it.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-clojure">What about Clojure?</h3>

<p>I’ve actually had the pleasure to use Clojure for personal fun, and a little bit
of professional use. I wrote a couple of libraries (<a href="https://github.com/ane/vigil">vigil</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ane/task">task</a>) and my
experience with has always been positive and its development experience is
excellent. Clojure isn’t a true Lisp, or well, it is part of the <em>Lisp
family</em>. Its ability to interface with the JVM makes it easy to leverage the
thousands of JVM libraries out there.</p>

<p>I’d gladly do it again, though I feel that Common Lisp with CLOS and its module
system makes it somewhat easier to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small"><em>programming in the large</em></a>. Clojure
explores interesting territories with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec">spec</a>, so it is interesting to see what
direction the language will take in the future.</p>

<h3 id="final-words-emacs-lisp">Final words: Emacs Lisp</h3>

<p>There’s also a parenthetical elephant in the room here: Emacs Lisp! An old
descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclisp">MacLisp</a>, it’s actually quite fun to write, and the fact that Emacs
itself is the interpreter, you have superb introspectability for any Elisp
code. Most of the Lisp I write these days is probably Emacs Lisp. It’s very
close to Common Lisp. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#Overview">cl-lib</a> adds a sufficient amount of convenience from
Common Lisp to make Elisp writing quite enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html#Top">EIEIO</a> adds a subset of CLOS
that can be used seamlessly with cl-lib. The condition system is missing.</p>

<p>I’ve also done a fair bit of <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a>, a Lisp that compiles to Lua. I used it to
write a <a href="https://github.com/ane/mudrally">small game</a> and it was fun to write since you could develop the game in a
REPL.</p>

<p>All in all, Lisp in all its variants is the most fun I’ve ever had while
programming a computer. Guile and Common Lisp are definitely the most fun I’ve
had programming in <em>Lisp</em>.</p>
