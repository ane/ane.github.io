## Software
{:.no_toc}

Over the course of many years I've written some code that might be
interesting to people. All of these tools are free software. Most likely more
can be found on [my Github profile](https://github.com/ane/).

### Libraries

Some libraries that you can use. Most of them involve async stuff using Clojure.

[task](http://ane.github.io/task)

: task brings better [Future](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html)s
  to your Clojure programs.

[vigil](http://ane.github.io/vigil)

: Vigil turns files into asynchronous byte streams.

[llama](http://ane.github.io/llama)

: Clojure bindings for [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org).

### Emacs

I'm an avid user of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I've
written some Emacs Lisp along the way. I don't use them a lot, though.

[rats.el](https://github.com/ane/rats.el)

: A test runner inside Emacs for [Go](https://golang.org). 

### Programs

These aren't probably useful for anyone, but here for the sake of curiosity.

[hisg](https://github.com/ane/hisg)

: hisg or *Haskell IRC statistics generator* was a silly attempt at creating
  statistics of IRC channels. One of my earliest Haskell bits.
  
[speedchurn](https://github.com/ane/speedchurn)

: A [Go](http://golang.org) variant of the former, didn't go very far either.

[pdu](https://github.com/ane/pdu)

: The unix [du](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_(Unix)) command, parallellized.
