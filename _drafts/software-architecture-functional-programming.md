<p class="lead">Software architecture is the art of building software systems. Traditional literature
  concerning software architecture is usually centered around object oriented languages.
  Do the same design principles apply in functional programming? How does one create scalable
  code bases in a functional programming environment?</p>

This post is the first in a series of posts titled *Software Architecture in Functional Programming*.

In this post, I present an very brief introduction to software architecture and introduce the motivation and principles
for designing software architecture. I explore the existing world of non-FP architecture and compare it to
patterns and principles found in FP software.

# Architectural scalability

## Elements of growth

## Motivation: keeping it together

# Proven approaches
