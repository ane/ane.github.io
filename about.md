title: About me 
---

I'm a programmer living in Jyväskylä, Finland. Professionally, I'm a software engineer.

This blog, a stereotypical technical blog, lets me clarify my thoughts on programming by writing about them. Posts are materializations of ideas I've written down suitable for longer elaboration.
