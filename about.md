Hi, I'm Antoine. I work as a software architect at
[Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com), where I build software for the telecom
industry. I live in Jyväskylä, Finland with my wife and
daughter.

At work I am the lead architect for a suite of products in the telecom sector,
building applications and systems telecom operators use to streamline their
business. I work as the hub in the center of engineering, design, product
management, and business expertise, ensuring technical excellence while we build
amazing things.

I've been programming since childhood, moving from silly games to desktop
software to the web and systems. I've worked with desktop software, web
applications, optimization software, machine learning, distributed databases,
and messaging systems. I've also done my fair share of user interface design. 

I write here about topics that interest me. I can't offer a single term that
could cover all the categories in this blog, although if I had to guess,
*software* might be a good one.

You if you have any questions you can reach me via [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or
