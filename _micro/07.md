Having fun with analog electronics. Turns out it's much more fun (and
challenging) to eschew microcontrollers. Lots of things can be done with
op-amps, comparators, 555 timers and some of the intermediate-complex stuff 
can be done using CMOS4000 series digital ICs. All of this is dirt cheap! Even
those 4000 series ICs cost a third of the cheapest 8-bit AVR micros.
