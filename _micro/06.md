Built the white noise generator. Turns out the baby doesn't need white noise to
fall asleep anymore. Next: UV index detector. I'll use a regular [405 nm ultraviolet
LED](https://www.mouser.fi/ProductDetail/593-VAOL5EUV0T4) as a *sensor*!
LEDs [can act as light
detectors](http://www.thebox.myzen.co.uk/Workshop/LED_Sensing.html), they won't
be as precise as real photodiodes, but it'll be close enough.
