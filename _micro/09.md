Nice, [IFTTT cross-posting to Twitter](http://ane.github.io/micro/202007220808)
works. It'll sync stuff on my own site to Twitter, but replies won't be
visible, doesn't matter. I was after [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) anyway.
Webmention replies *should* work but Twitter doesn't support that - I won't see
Twitter replies.
