Hi! Welcome to my website. I'm Antoine, I work as a software architect at
[Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com). I have over a decade of industry experience, and I've built desktop
software, web applications, computer games, optimization software, user interfaces and platform
systems.

On this website you'll find writings about every aspect of software engineering, from [programming
 and programming languages](/programming), general [software architecture](/architecture), to [web
 development](/webdev). I'm especially interested in [software product design](), and also on the
 business side of things I've written about [use case analysis](), [feature design](), [modelling]()
 and [requirements engineering](). I find writing [architectural descriptions]() to be quite
 interesting.
