Hi, I'm Antoine. I work as a software architect at
[Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com), where I build software for the telecom
industry. I live in Jyväskylä, Finland with my wife and daughter.

I've been programming since childhood, moving from silly games to desktop
software to the web and systems. I've worked with desktop software, web
applications, optimization software, machine learning, distributed databases,
and messaging systems. I've also done my fair share of user interface design.
These past years I've worked a lot with product design and product
development in the telecom sector.

I write here about topics that interest me. I can't offer a single term that
could cover all the categories in this blog, although if I had to guess,
*software* might be a good one.

You if you have any questions you can reach me via [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or
