Hi, my name is Antoine. I'm a software professional from Jyväskylä, Finland. I work as a software
architect at [Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com).

I've been programming since childhood, moving from games to desktop software to the web. I've worked with
desktop software, web applications, optimization software, machine learning, distributed databases, and 
messaging systems. I've also done my fair share of user interface design. These past years I've worked a lot 
with product design and product development in the telecom sector. 

I write here about topics that interest me. I can't offer a single term that could cover all the
categories in this blog, although if I had to guess, *software* might be a good one.

You if you have any questions you can reach me via [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anewtf).
