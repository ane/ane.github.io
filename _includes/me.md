I'm a programmer living in Jyväskylä, Finland. I work as a software architect
at [Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com) specializing in systems integration.

I've been programming since childhood, from games to desktop software, but these days I specialize
in distributed systems and databases. In the past I've built desktop software, web applications,
optimization software, and done user interface design. I'm a big enthusiast of functional
programming and Lisp, and the design of programming languages.

Most of my spare time is spent doing exercise, either powerlifting or cycling, or
reading. Occasionally I post in this blog, where I write about programming and other topics that I
find interesting. When I have the passion or time I do some programming as well. You might also want
to check whatever I've done on [Github](https://github.com/ane).

You if you have any questions you can reach me via [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or
