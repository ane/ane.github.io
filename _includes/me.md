Hi, my name is Antoine. I'm a software professional from Jyväskylä, Finland. I work as a software
architect at [Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com).

I've been programming since childhood, moving from games to desktop software to the web. I've worked with
desktop software, web applications, optimization, machine learning, messaging systems. These past years 
I've worked a lot with product design and product development. I've also done user interface design and web design 
in my early days.

I write here about topics that interest me. I can't offer a single term that could cover all the
categories in this blog, although if I had to guess, *software* might be a good one.

You if you have any questions you can reach me via [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or
