    <div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting problem: suppose you have an event-driven system that
needs to respond to events in while the system is running, as they happen, and
the responses themselves are based on a configuration of rules that can be
changed while the system is running, from a configuration user interface. The
changes are infrequent and manual, and done by a human. The problem is this:
since reloading the latest configuration always takes time, how do you build the
runtime configuration capability without causing performance problems in the
event processor?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of this is some business rule engine that performs actions based
on users interacting with a system. The rules for these actions are configurable
in a separate application, like a web interface, doesn&#8217;t matter. The application
configures the ruleset and the engine executes them. Once the rules are in
effect, the engine is suppose to reflect the new configuration immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s call the engine an <strong>event processor</strong> and the configuration application as
the <strong>configuration tool</strong>.  The task of the event processor is to respond to
events flowing in from the surrounding environment. Concretely this could mean
an event stream of some kind, let&#8217;s leave that abstract. It doesn&#8217;t matter where
they come from or what the events are, we simply need to assume that the system
has to respond to each one of them. The responses are based on business logic
executed according to a configuration. This configuration is updated by humans</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the configuration will always live in some external storage system for
persistence purposes, there is a cost for retrieving the data from this storage
system. We want to minimize the costs occurring from retrieving this
configuration data while keeping the system as accurate as possible. With
accuracy I mean once the configuration tool is used to update the system
configuration, the event processor respects those updates. What we also want is
to make the configuration as easy as possible. The sequence diagram in <a href="#seq">Figure 1</a>
illustrates how the event processing and rules are tied together.</p>
</div>
<div id="seq" class="imageblock float-sm-right ml-3">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. How the system works</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We judge the system by three metrics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Usability</strong>: how easy it is to update the configuration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> once updated, how quickly are the configuration updates reflected
in the results of the event processor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: how well does the event processor scale in performance when the amount of
incoming events increases?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The combination of the event processor and the configuration tool forms a
system. We want to keep this system as performant, accurate, and user friendly
as possible. There are several ways to do this.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="naive"><a class="anchor" href="#naive"></a>No caching, reload on every event</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The naïve approach is to fetch configuration on every event. This would cause a
database fetch on every event. This is most likely the scenario we want to
avoid, but it is not without merit. The changes are reflected immediately. The
database engine might be able to cache repeated reads and optimize the read
latency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach has the maximum accuracy, but contains potential performances
problems. The system is accurate, the configuration update <strong>immediately</strong> alters
the behavior. The configuration tool is also usable since its usage has an
immediate effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keep in mind that out of all the listed approaches in this post, <strong>this</strong> might be
the simplest and most reliable out of all. After all, reading data is relatively
cheap, and modern RDBMSes have robust caching algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, this approach smells. For $n$ events you get $n$ calls, and we <strong>know</strong>
that the frequency of configuration updates is much, much less than $n$! So in
terms of performance, this might not scale that well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless, we can try minimizing calls to the database. There are two simple
solutions: local and temporal caching. While I mention caches, I do not mean
implementing your own full-fledged caching system, since that is always a bad
idea, I mean implementing application logic that transparently prevents
excessive calls to the database.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="invent-a-code-level-cache"><a class="anchor" href="#invent-a-code-level-cache"></a>Invent a code-level cache</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One approach, if we are talking about plain RDBMS reads, is to use temporal
versioning in the configuration data. This works when the query to fetch the
whole configuration data is complicated and time-consuming, but the query to
fetch one single column is cheap. For instance, consider this pseudoish Scala
code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

    <span class="tok-n">newConfig</span>
  <span class="tok-o">}</span>
<span class="tok-o">}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Readers, please ignore purity and referential transparency.) Upon every call to
<code>getConfiguration</code>, the code fetches a date-time value from the database and
compares the version of the data we already have. If the data is out of date,
the data is reloaded from the database, otherwise the old data is returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a naive code-level cache, and it&#8217;s very simple. But it turns out to work
nicely even in a distributed scenario: provided the write operations are handled
properly, no single instance of the application will end up having mixed
configuration data at time instant \(X\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of usability, this is completely transparent to the user. Just click
"Save" and the configuration is updated. Its accuracy is also in line with the
naïve method, but it still causes one database read operation on every
event. Although smaller, the performance cost still scales linearly with the
number of incoming events.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="use-timers"><a class="anchor" href="#use-timers"></a>Use timers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Timed reads are also possible. You can set an arbitrary refresh interval and
indicate to your users that you need expect configuration data to be in effect
every X seconds or so. This makes the whole data reading problem go away but no
longer makes it possible to do real-time adjustments. For some systems this can
be unacceptable, though I think for most business-oriented products this is more
than acceptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interval caching, that is, timed refreshes every $t$ seconds is a way to
ensure the amount of database reads is fixed. For instance, imagine our naive
scenario whereby the database is accessed upon every request, and imagine if the
event processor would handle thousands of requests per second!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The acceptability of this solution depends on the use cases of the
application. Is the application supposed to react instantly to configuration
changes? Is there any tolerance to a latency between the instant the changes
were effected and between the instant they are actually used? If there is a
tolerance to a latency of $t$ seconds&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;meaning, the users of the application
can be told somehow that "changes might take $t$ to come into effect", then this
solution might be one of the simplest. Even having the shared refresh interval
to be 1 second will never burden the database and yet at the same time be
acceptable to the end users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet, the application has to concede that it&#8217;s no longer operating in real
time. Informing that changes might take some time to come into effect can give
the impression that the system is slow. That said, the interval can be in the
second or sub-second range. All we want is to limit the number of database reads
to some linear value, instead of scaling with the amount of incoming
requests. So even using a fixed interval of 100 seconds means at most 600
requests per minute, which is not a lot for any modern database. And you can go
lower, increase it to 6000 per minute. So at that point telling the users that
their changes might take up to 100 milliseconds to come into play would be
pointless, depending on context.  For 99% of the user-facing applications this
is a perfectly acceptable method <strong>unless</strong> there is absolutely no tolerance,
not even in the millisecond range, for latency. In that case other alternatives
must be pursued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a timer approach we&#8217;ve got user-friendliness at maximum, since there is
still a "Save" button, and it works in real time<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>, that
is, the application need not be restarted for the configuration to take effect.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="staged-read-only-configurations"><a class="anchor" href="#staged-read-only-configurations"></a>Staged read-only configurations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other solution would be to make the system “staged” – configuration cannot
be updated in real time, the event processor loads the data in memory at
application startup, and any alterations to the configuration requires
restarting the system. But this system is no longer “live”, and requires the
extra restart step from its users. On the other hand, there are no performance
implications, since the data is in memory for fast access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From a usability perspective I would rate this lower than the previous
approaches since it requires manual deployments. You must now decide if you can
live with downtime or not. Without downtime, you must use some sort of rolling
restarts. This incurs an accuracy penalty, since some systems not yet
restarted might process events using a configuration that is out of date. Or,
you go for the downtime approach, which has no accuracy penalty, but might be
unacceptable from a business or usability perspective.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="use-a-real-cache-to-get-fast-reads"><a class="anchor" href="#use-a-real-cache-to-get-fast-reads"></a>Use a real cache to get fast reads</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another solution would be to cache the configuration data into a fast in-memory
database, where reads are cheap, and have the configuration data trickle there
from the master database. But this installs a failure point and potential
consistency issues (how do you ensure this works when the system is
distributed?) and requires careful engineering to work reliably and efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is <a href="#naive">much like the first approach</a>, a complete read for every event, but the external
cache attempts to minimize the cost of the read operation. This gets us maximal
accuracy and user-friendliness, but the performance aspect now becomes
murkier. Are there limits to the caching system? Can we rely on it in 100% of
calls?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also introduces latency to the question of accuracy: data between the
principal system and the cache must be kept in sync. The speed at which that
happens must be instantaneous. Is that guaranteed? Does this work when the data
systems are distributed across the globe?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is more, this is just <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925">moving the
problem around (see truth 6)</a>. I don&#8217;t want to do that unless absolutely
necessary. I certainly don&#8217;t want to be answering the above questions.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="conclusions"><a class="anchor" href="#conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This presents a tough problem for use cases when a system is in continuous
operation. From my experience, usually the simplest solution is the best. I&#8217;ve
found any of the first four solutions to work adequately, but they all have
different impacts on the end users. I&#8217;ve had bad experiences by using external
caching applications (like <a href="http://memcached.org/">Memcached</a>) in front of
read-only data from databases, as they introduce points of failure and introduce
operative overhead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would recommend starting with the naïve approach first, no caching. When or if
that becomes too much, only then try some of the other approaches. The
code-level cache is easy to implement using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">STM</a>. The
timer-based approach works well if your application permits some latency in its
operating mode, which is most likely the case for most user-facing applications
out there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m certain there are more ways to solve this problem, but after a round of
searching I couldn&#8217;t really find anything. If any reader has some ideas, do not
hesitate to email me with them!</p>
