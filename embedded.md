## Embedded development

I don't know what exactly attracts me in embedded development, but
I've always found it fascinating. Perhaps it's there's no abundance of resources
and computing power? My day job involves designing software where this isn't a
concern -- you can generally just throw more hardware at things (up to a point)
-- so perhaps the presence of constraints are what makes things interesting.
