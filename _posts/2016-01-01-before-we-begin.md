Now that the design of the site is finished, I can finally focus on the essentials.

I've decided that this year I will be writing a bit more, here, and
elsewhere. To that end, when it comes to this site, I've had to perform a simple
but challenging task: lowering standards. I wasn't publishing much because I had exceedingly high standards for content. Under
those standards, Every blog post had to be a thoroughly researched and carefully
argued piece, capable of standing the test of time.

This was a monumental mistake.

Researching something thoroughly requires an extraordinary amount of time, and
writing opinionated articles that stand the test of time requires an
extraordinary amount of foresight &mdash; neither of which I have, yet. I have already managed to delete one post that contained opinions I no longer
agreed with, because I was thinking that its content was wrong and I was a
moron for publishing it.

My desire for more content stems from the process of gradual improvement. The
more you write the better you get. And I cannot do this unless I start from the
very basics. I could, of course, simply write guides on how to do XYZ with $THING, but I want
to tell stories, not write recipes. This doesn't mean there won't be any guides,
however!

The desire for increased content and its frequency also stems from the simple
fact that somebody *reads* this. Besides Google Analytics telling me so, a
few weeks ago I even received a
[pull request](https://github.com/ane/ane.github.io/pull/1) for typo fixes.


So I know there's at least *one* guy who actually reads every word. Disclosure:
according to GA, most of the visits are "accidental redirects" (huh?), and that
actual, longer visits aren't common, but there were enough for me to extrapolate
that there were, at the very least, *two* readers.

So, that was the background. And now comes the disclaimer, of sorts.

This site is a blog. As this site is a blog, the writings are, first and
foremost, opinion pieces, not research articles, and opinions change. You may
find me advocating for stricter type systems one day, and for looser the
next. I will only guarantee that, at *the time of writing*, I will argue my
points to the best of my abilities.

Longer, more in-depth stories, if ever completed, are available under the
*articles* category. This is to mark a distinction. To qualify as an article,
the writing will a) contain properly researched writing and references b) be
reviewed by somebody else. I'm currently
[working on something](http://ane.iki.fi/ebi) that may one day be considered
something like that.

You're welcome to snoop in the
[drafts](https://github.com/ane/ane.github.io/tree/master/_drafts) folder of the
GitHub repository of the site, but be warned, that stuff is obviously incomplete.

To be continued.
