I'm a software engineer living in Jyväskylä, Finland. I work
at [Qvantel](http://www.qvantel.com).

This is my website. Its front page behaves like a blog, but the [index](/archive/) will let you find
posts easily. The content is mostly about programming and software, though other topics may appear
in the future.

For a bit of background, you can read a [a meta post of sorts]({% post_url
2016-01-01-before-we-begin %}) that describes the tone of the writings you will find on this
site. It's rather outdated though, as the topics aren't limited to programming anymore, as the
stereotypical technical blog is rather boring.

You can drop me an [email](mailto:ane@iki.fi) or find me on [Github](https://github.com/ane).
